# Cookies-Sales-with-PowerBI

Project Overview: This introductory reading material.

Introduction: You're tasked with creating a Power BI report for Cookie Bliss, a cookie manufacturer, to help visualize their sales data and make better decisions.

Setup:

Project Steps:

Import data into Power BI. Open Power BI, click on "Get Data" and choose "Excel Workbook." Import the provided Excel data file.
Load the data into Power BI, either as it is or transform it using Power Query to clean it up if needed.
Start building visuals, like bar charts, line charts, and maps, to display key metrics (e.g., sales data).
Apply a theme to the report and add filters to make it easier to explore the data.
Publish your report to share it with your team.


Data Cleaning:

Open Power Query Editor to modify your data.
Replace values: For example, change "US" in the "Country" column to "United States."
Remove columns: Delete unnecessary columns like "Rush Shipment."

Data Relationships:

Link your tables using Customer ID. Power BI might do this automatically, but if not, you can create the connection manually by dragging one field to the other.
Next Step: Youâ€™re ready to start adding visuals and building your report!
